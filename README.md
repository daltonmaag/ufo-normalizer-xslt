# XLST stylesheet for UFO normalization

This is an alternative to [ufoNormalizer](https://github.com/unified-font-object/ufoNormalizer)
based on XSLT. It should yield mostly the same output as `ufoNormalizer`.

It's been in use at Dalton Maag for several years. We're releasing it as
open-source (Apache 2) in the hope to help with establishing
[a recommended UFO normalization format](https://github.com/unified-font-object/ufo-spec/issues/144).

The test UFOs are Mutator Sans from https://github.com/LettError/mutatorSans
